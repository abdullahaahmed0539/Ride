# Ride-FYP

A decentralized, blockchain-based, ride-sharing application for mobile devices that aims to remove middlemen from the circle to provide the maximum return to the driver while costing as little as possible.

We will be using Solidity for our smart contracts, which will be deployed on the Ethereum mainnet. Instead of having to carry cash and worrying about not having any change, we'll allow people to purchase special cryptocurrency meant only to be used for this application.

Our applications, aside from decentralization, plans to bring a lot of new features and solutions to existing problems that our rival companies have not been able to fix despite being in the market for a long time.
